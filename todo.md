# Todo
- missing faction portraits:
    gang
    inquisition
    islandfolk
    monarchy
    orthodoxy
    skinless

- fix quotee on creature and faction - character stays the same, characters should have their own quotes
- menu mouseover dropdown - (creatures under characters to begin with)
- add story pages - list of chapters, chapters, list of writing thoughts, themes, etc

- default 404 photo for missing image (something cute! amaelia with her nose in a book and raised eyebrow? or squinting with sweatdrop on forehead?) and handling

- make like little lore notes like literal letters "embedded" on certain pages to make them look like literal notes and give them the courier text if its machine written, italic handwriting etc if so.
generally just be creative with styling, shit like that is cool.

- restructure images for all data types like: character.images.profile_images og character.images.gallery_images etc - just make it more like a dictionary of images so you can choose in your scripts whether you want to load all images for a data entity or just a few particular ones.

- Make an ESSENCE banner/header (just a block letter drawing of the title with the logo in it somewhere) (for navbar + frontpage)
- make overlay art
- draw some more cartoony sketches of the characters, give them some charicature and personality, perhaps just portraits that can be used for the wiki and or game
- background texture for navbar

- on the top right a little audio player where you can toggle bg music - leave off as default!

- footer with list of all of the current category you're viewing or list of all categories or simply list of all entries in the wiki organized by category

- design illandras inquisitors
- make a page for "the golden donut" under deities/entities - perhaps it can be the creativity/curiousity deity

nice to have:

- make a little recursive loop counter when you click a link that takes you to the same page you're already on - make a little banner if the user traverses the loop x amount of times and reward them with the title of nerd/"Congratulations, you have delved too deep. You are now going in circles. You have reached a point where you do not know what is beginning and what is end - perhaps it's time to get back to the surface."
- maybe add links to quotees
- perhaps a collapsable menus on the left side of each page in which you can get a folder structure view of all site data and articles
- implement tags
- maybe gallery at the bottom of article (like all pictures of a character)
- make a style guide - i.e. set 5-6 colors main colors as variables and then just use those where applicable
- find fonts (for headers and paragraphs) - the ones you have now are ok, but when it feels like its all coming together, try and see if you can find ones that "just feel right"

- support several pics for character portrait
- full image view popup thingy on portraits (and later on other big images)
- make it possible for an article's data, like say a character, to have multiple images for their portrait - if they do, make little tabs on top of the image so that you can cycle through them - those tabs need names/indicators as well (normal, overworld, portrait, bossfight, transformed, etc)
