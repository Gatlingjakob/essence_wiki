# Todo

- make it possible for an article's data to like a character to have multiple images for their portrait - if they do, make little tabs on top of the image so that you can cycle through them - those tabs need names/indicators as well (normal, overworld, portrait, bossfight, transformed, etc)

prettify the key-names from json ("eye_color" is presented as "Eye Color")

make subheaders for article info box

generate proper spacing between values 

generally adjust margin, padding, border, font type, take insp from funger and wikipedia

full image view popup thingy on portraits (and later on other big images)

- Make a ESSENCE banner/logo thing
- Make an actual logo for the franchise - like an eye or brain or some mystical symbol that feels near to your heart
- make overlay art

- design top menu (put mini versions of the logo on both sides of the menu)

- dropdowns on top menu - only after youve made subcategories i suppose

- on the top right a little audio player where you can toggle bg music - leave off as default!

- Add another type of data - factions for example - factions.json, factions.html, faction.html

try to make a style guide - i.e. set 5-6 colors main colors as variables and then just use those where applicable

footer with list of all of the current category you're viewing or list of all categories or simply list of all entries in the wiki organized by category

nice to have:
- perhaps a collapsable menus on the left side of each page in which you can get a folder structure view of all site data and articles
- implement tags
- maybe gallery at the bottom of article (like all pictures of a character)
