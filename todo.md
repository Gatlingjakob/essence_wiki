# Todo

- make it possible for an article's data to like a character to have multiple images for their portrait - if they do, make little tabs on top of the image so that you can cycle through them - those tabs need names/indicators as well (normal, overworld, portrait, bossfight, transformed, etc)

prettify the key-names from json ("eye_color" is presented as "Eye Color")

- Make a ESSENCE banner/logo thing
- Make an actual logo for the franchise - like an eye or brain or some mystical symbol that feels near to your heart

- design top menu (put mini versions of the logo on both sides of the menu)

- Add another type of data - factions for example - factions.json, factions.html, faction.html

nice to have:
- perhaps a collapsable menus on the left side of each page in which you can get a folder structure view of all site data and articles
