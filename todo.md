# Todo

- fix quotee on creature, apply same changes everywhere else
- menu mouseover dropdown - (creatures under characters to begin with)

- missing image image and handlings

- add story pages - list of chapters, chapters, list of writing thoughts, themes, etc
- restructure images for all data types like: character.images.profile_images og character.images.gallery_images etc
- support several pics for character portrait
- full image view popup thingy on portraits (and later on other big images)
- make it possible for an article's data to like a character to have multiple images for their portrait - if they do, make little tabs on top of the image so that you can cycle through them - those tabs need names/indicators as well (normal, overworld, portrait, bossfight, transformed, etc)

- on the top right a little audio player where you can toggle bg music - leave off as default!
- dropdowns on top menu - only after youve made subcategories i suppose

- footer with list of all of the current category you're viewing or list of all categories or simply list of all entries in the wiki organized by category

- Make an ESSENCE banner/logo thing (for navbar + frontpage)
- Make an actual logo for the franchise - like an eye or brain or some mystical symbol that feels near to your heart
- make overlay art
- fix background overlay
- draw some more cartoony sketches of the characters, give them some charicature and personality, perhaps just portraits that can be used for the wiki and or game
- background texture for navbar

- find fonts (for headers and paragraphs) - the ones you have now are ok, but when it feels like its all coming together, try and see if you can find ones that "just feel right"

- make like little lore notes "embedded" on certain pages to make them look like literal notes and give them the courier text if its machine written, italic handwriting etc if so.
generally just be creative with styling, shit like that is cool.

- make a page for "the golden donut" under deities

nice to have:
- perhaps a collapsable menus on the left side of each page in which you can get a folder structure view of all site data and articles
- implement tags
- maybe gallery at the bottom of article (like all pictures of a character)
- make a style guide - i.e. set 5-6 colors main colors as variables and then just use those where applicable
