# Todo

narrow down all pages and give them a background on the sides with an overlay

add an actual character and define an actual data structure

character info box to the right and then on top if mobile, always a title on the very top (character_name, faction name etc)

make it possible for an article's data to like a character to have multiple images for their portrait - if they do, make little tabs on top of the image so that you can cycle through them - those tabs need names/indicators as well (normal, overworld, portrait, bossfight, transformed, etc)

Add another type of data - factions for example - factions.json, factions.html, faction.html

perhaps a collapsable menus on the left side of each page in which you can get a folder structure view of all site data and articles
