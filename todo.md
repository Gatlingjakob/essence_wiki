# Todo

add styles and pages to folders, but wait till you can upload dir to ai to let it show you the smartest way

character info box to the right and then on top if mobile, always a title on the very top (character_name, faction name etc)

find a way to ensure slugs are always unique - perhaps fine if true for just the page/data type it pertains to (character, faction, etc)

Add another type of data - factions for example - factions.json, factions.html, faction.html
